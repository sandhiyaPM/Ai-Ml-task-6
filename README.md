# Ai-Ml-task-6
Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification on the Iris dataset using Scikit-learn.
Performed feature scaling, trained models with different K values, and evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Visualized model accuracy for varying K and plotted decision boundaries to illustrate classification regions.
